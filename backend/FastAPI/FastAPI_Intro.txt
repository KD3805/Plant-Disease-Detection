-> FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.


-> FastAPI has high performance and it is fast, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).

	-> Pydantic is data validation and settings management using python type annotation. It is used to send parameters from frontend to api.


-> FastAPI uses ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface).

	-> ASGI, or Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface, is a standard interface that allows web servers to communicate with web applications and frameworks. 

	-> It's designed to support asynchronous and concurrent processing, which allows web applications to handle multiple requests at the same time.

	-> In order to implement ASGI, we have to use 'uvicorn' (uvicorn is an ASGI server).



# Execution:

1. Open Anaconda prompt:

2. Create virtual environment:
	i) pip install virtualenv
	ii) virtualenv myenv
			OR
	-> python -m venv myenv

3. Activate virtual environment:
	i) myenv\Scripts\activate

4. Install required libraries:
	-> pip install fastapi uvicorn

5. Move to the actual folder, where 'main.py' file is stored:
	e.g. - cd D:\Learning medium\ML\FastAPI

6. Run the server:
	-> uvicorn <file_name>:<obj_name> --reload
	e.g. - uvicorn main:app --reload
